# YACC (Yet Another Calculator Compiler)

## 👷‍♂️ WIP
This is still very much a work in progress. The spirit of the project is to let those new to compilers and interpreters to get their hands dirty implementing a simple calculator! To get a feel for where the project is heading, check out the unfinished [site](https://cameronbourke.github.io/YACC/site/).

## The Dilemma
The year is 1973. You find yourself having just been hired by the US Department of Defense to work on the next greatest missile system. You can't believe you actually landed the job! On your first day, the program manager shows you the ropes. You can't help but be excited, [Version 4 Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix) has just been released and you've been told that they have it running on their new [PDP11's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11). As the manager leaves you at your desk, they briefly mention that there is no tolerance for miss calculations. You quickly reply with a sharp ofcourse! It then dawns on you, the calculator program on Unix, [dc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program>), is in postfix notation! A wave of panic washes over you as recall how mistake prone you are with this notation. You simply can't do your job with dc.
